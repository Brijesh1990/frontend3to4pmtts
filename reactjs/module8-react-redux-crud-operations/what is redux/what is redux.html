what is redux ?
  Redux is a library of react js 
  
  Redux is used for state managements or handel state managements 
  
  Redux used redux tools to handel state managements 
  
  Redux is used to allow us to read react components data from a Redux store.
  
  Redux dispatch actions to store to update data.
  
  Redux help apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model.  
  
  A state management systems for cross-component  or app-wide  state
  Redux used a wide for web applications.

  Redux is an libraries that is used to manage data and provides more libraries to manage its data in very simple way.

  Redux is a useful solution for organising application state and provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It's a well-known framework for managing state in React projects, but it also works with Angular, Vue. js, and plain old JavaScript.

Advantage of Redux ?
    a) Redux is unidrectional data flow 
    b) Redux used for state managements to update or store data.
    c) Redux does not have Dispatcher concept
    d) Redux has an only one store where as flux has many  store.
    e) Redux action objects will be recieved and handeled directly by store
    f) Redux provides a complex architectures 
    g) It encourage a good 'React architectures' 
    h) Redux is an tools or libraries of react

React redux life cycle .....

    1) state
    2) UI
    3) actions
    4) reducer
    5) store

Explain redux life cycle............

 1) state:state is a simple object that can be stored or used to update | modify any data from one components to another components.

 2) UI :generalized user interface
 
 3) actions :Action is sent or dispatched from the view which are payloads that can be read by reducres.

 It is a pure object created to store the information of users event.
It includes informations such as type action , time of occurence, location of occurence.

Its cordinates with state and its aim to change something in apps. 

  
4) reducer : Reducer is one type of functions where we access some globals variables also.
Reducer read the payloads from action and then performed updates the store via the state.
It is pure function to return view state from the initial state. 


 5) store : A store is place where the entire state of your applications lists.
it manages the status of the applications and has a dispatch(action) in function.
it is a like a brain that is resposible for all moving parts in Redux.


How to install a redux in react js ...
npm install redux react-redux --save
npm install redux 
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap --save 


1) Counter app in React redux 

npm install redux react-redux --save
npm install redux 
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap --save 
App directory 
actions=>index.jsx
components=>Counter.jsx
container=>counterContainer.jsx
reducer=>index.jsx

/src/index.jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import reducer from '../src/reducer/index'
import App from '../src/App'
import './index.css';

const store = createStore(
   reducer,
   window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && 
   window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__())
render
(
   <Provider store = {store}>
      <App />
   </Provider>, document.getElementById('root'))

This is our root component of react. It is responsible for rendering counter container component as a child.

/src/app.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Counter from './container/counterContainer';

class App extends Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <div className = "App">
            <header className = "App-header">
               <Counter/>
            </header>
         </div>
      );
   }}
export default App;

The following is the container component which is responsible for providing Redux’s state to react component −
/container/counterContainer.js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import Counter from '../component/counter'
import { increment, decrement, reset } from '../actions';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
   return {
      counter: state
   };
};
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
   return {
      increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
      decrement: () => dispatch(decrement()),
      reset: () => dispatch(reset())
   };
};
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

Given below is the react component responsible for view part −
/component/counter.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
class Counter extends Component {
   render()
 {
      const {counter,increment,decrement,reset} = this.props;
      return (
         <div className = "App">
            <div>{counter}</div>
            <div>
               <button onClick = {increment}>INCREMENT BY 1</button>
            </div>
            <div>
               <button onClick = {decrement}>DECREMENT BY 1</button>
            </div>
            <button onClick = {reset}>RESET</button>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
export default Counter;

The following are the action creators responsible for creating an action −
/actions/index.js

export function increment() {
   return {
      type: 'INCREMENT'
   }
}
export function decrement() {
   return {
      type: 'DECREMENT'
   }
}
export function reset(){
   return { type: 'RESET' 
}
}

Below, we have shown line of code for reducer file which is responsible for updating the state in Redux.

reducer/index.js

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
   switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1
      case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1
      case 'RESET' : return 0 default: return state
   }
}
export default reducer;
